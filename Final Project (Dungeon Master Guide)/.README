# Dugeon Master Guide
#The Project covers the needs for a Dungeon Master
## I built this for those who take on the role of a Dungeon Master may have an easier time managing the general needs of their campaign.
## All 3 files are need. The main file being "DungeonMasterGuide" This part is in the main class that navigates you to your selected scene.
 rbNPC.setOnAction(e -> {
            if (rbNPC.isSelected()) {
                character.raceName(primaryStage);
            }
        });
		rbEncounter.setOnAction(e -> {
            if (rbEncounter.isSelected()) {
				Tundra tundra = new Tundra();
				tundra.displayEncounters(primaryStage);
            }
        });

##I run the code through javafx and use JUnit4 to test it
## I did this program by myself but others can change it to how they see fit. 
##For instance in Wilderness encounter it is specifically for the campaign "Icewind Dale" so it will only generate encounters from there 
##but can be rearranged to fit your needs.
