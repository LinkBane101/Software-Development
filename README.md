### Class: Software-Development

This file will hold the code I make during my classes here at Southwest Tech. This one is specifically for Software Development class 1800.

I may not be like many others who go into any type of programming with years of knowledge behind them but I have a determination to continue to learn whatever level I am at. I have been told I am a fast learner from jobs I have been in already. I graduated from Milford High School and was able to get an associetes degree in General Science at Southern Utah University.

I plan on taking this program so that I may gain a better understanding of Software development to then eventaully start a job in the trade.
